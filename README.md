#Project Description
1.alu-AirBnB_clone
* This Project is series of tasks with aim of creating a clone of AirBnB website. At first we start by making the command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.
* This is very important step we will use what we built duriing this project with allother following projects.
WHAT IS COMMAND INTERPRETER?
Is the same a shell ut it is limited to some specific use-case.

#Let's See the Steps Invlved in this project
A. The console
Here we're creating th data model also we manage (create, update, destroy etc) objects via a console/command interpreter and lastly we store and persits to a file(JSON file).
Means the first piece is to manipulate a powerful storate system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

#Web static
learn HTML/CSS
create the HTML of your application
create template of each object

#MySQL storage
replace the file storage by a Database storage
map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

#Web framework - templating
create your first web server in Python
make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

#RESTful API
expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

#Web dynamic
learn JQuery
load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API
